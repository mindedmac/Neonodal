# Neonodal

**Neonodal** is a Python-based graph-theory exploration toolkit designed for clarity and extensibility.  
It allows you to build, explore, and visualize network/graph structures — e.g., directed and undirected node systems — with simple configuration and example scripts.

---

## Highlights

- Implementations of graph types such as star-networks, intertwined nets, directional/undirectional graphs.  
- Easy example workflows via `main.py`.  
- Focused on readability and educational value: perfect for students (like me) or anyone exploring network/graph theory in Python.  
- Licensed under the MIT License.

## Installation & Requirements

  ```bash
   1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/mindedmac/Neonodal.git
   cd Neonodal
   2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install dependencies:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   3. (Optional) If you expand the project, add any further dependencies to requirements.txt.
   ```

**Basic Concepts & Graph Theory Background**

Neonodal is grounded in standard graph-theory constructs:

    Nodes (vertices): the fundamental units.
    Edges (links): the connections between nodes — may be directed or undirected.
    Network/Graph Topologies: e.g., stars, trees, intertwined networks.

If you’re unfamiliar with graph theory, a good starting point: [Graph theory on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)
The project also draws inspiration from a YouTube series: [Graph Theory With Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLIPpKeh9v3ZFEHvNd5xqUrCkqLgXnekL)

At present, it is a lightweight but flexible toolkit for educational and exploratory graph-theory work in Python.
Future enhancements may include:

    better visualizations (e.g., graphical UI or interactive web viewer)
    performance optimizations (for larger networks)
    more graph-algorithms (search, path-finding, clustering, etc.)

Thanks for exploring Neonodal — and happy graphing!
